                "content": "VMPL Pune (Maharashtra) [India], June 23: In a city where residential towers rise as quickly as ambitions, Saheel Properties is emerging as a name that doesn't just build homes, it builds futures. With its flagship initiative, the ITrend Series, the Pune-based real estate company is steering the industry in a bold new direction: toward thoughtful, lifestyle-first development designed for the modern urban Indian. Also Read | Diwali 2025 Start and End Dates: When Is Deepawali? Know Dhanteras, Choti Diwali and Lakshmi Puja Timings, Important Rituals and Significance To Celebrate the Festival. Over the last few years, Pune's transformation into a vibrant tech and education hub has reshaped the demand for housing but Saheel Properties saw something deeper, i.e., a shift in how people live. The ITrend Series was born not just to answer that need but to anticipate it. Today, it is being hailed by industry insiders and buyers alike as a benchmark in contemporary urban housing, where design intelligence, smart space utilization, and emotional comfort converge. With ongoing and completed projects across high-demand zones such as Wakad, Tathawade, Baner NX, Hinjawadi, Chinchwad, and Ravet, ITrend properties offer not just prime connectivity but an ecosystem that supports modern living. However, what sets the series apart is its commitment to redefining the fundamentals of home design. This isn't luxury for luxury's sake; it's lifestyle logic, executed with engineering excellence.

Homes within the series come with zero space wastage, flexible layouts, and convertible usage zones, allowing residents to adapt spaces as their needs change. From compact apartments that feel expansive to two-bedroom homes that serve like a three, each layout is a masterclass in space efficiency. Added amenities such as in-wing guest suites, dedicated work-from-home pods, and exclusive visitor parking only enhance the liveability factor. This design foresight is no accident. Saheel's team spent years understanding the post-pandemic lifestyle shift, how people work, socialize, and retreat within their homes. What emerged was a blueprint for responsive living. Not trends for the moment, but solutions for a lifetime. \"We didn't just ask what people want today,\" says a spokesperson at Saheel Properties. \"We asked what they'll need ten years from now, and built with that in mind.\" Beyond architecture, what truly powers the ITrend Series is trust. In an industry where delays and overpromises are far too common, Saheel has delivered over 2,500 homes on time, every time. Known for transparency, quality, and integrity, the company has cultivated a reputation that few developers can claim, and buyers can count on. The ITrend Series has also forced a larger conversation within Pune's real estate circles. Its popularity is pushing the industry to re-evaluate what constitutes real value: not marble-laden lobbies, but functional layouts. Not excessive amenities, but intuitive planning. Not brochure claims, but lived comfort. In doing so, ITrend is not just a housing brand, it's a mindset shift. The journey doesn't stop here. With several upcoming launches, Saheel Properties plans to scale the ITrend philosophy even further, integrating smart automation, sustainable construction, and curated community design. The future ITrend homes will not just be addresses, but anchor points of a balanced and fulfilling urban lifestyle. As Pune continues its upward trajectory as one of India's most liveable cities, Saheel Properties is proving that the future of real estate lies not in replicating what's been done, but in anticipating what's next. And through the ITrend Series, they're not just keeping pace with the city, they're leading it. (ADVERTORIAL DISCLAIMER: The above press release has been provided by VMPL.

                "content": "Prithvi Shaw has written to the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) seeking a transfer ahead of the upcoming domestic season. \"I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) for the valuable opportunities and unwavering support extended to me during my time representing the association,\" Shaw wrote in the letter, which an MCA official confirmed the body had received. \"It has truly been an honor and a privilege to be part of the MCA setup, and I am deeply grateful for the exposure and experience I have gained here.\" Explaining his reasons for wanting to leave Shaw wrote: \"At this juncture in my career, I have been presented with a promising opportunity to play professional cricket under another State Association, which I believe will further contribute to my growth and development as a cricketer. \"In light of this, I kindly request you to issue me a No Objection Certificate (NOC) that will enable me to officially represent the new State Association in the upcoming domestic season.\" Shaw said his decision has been made after \"careful consideration, and with utmost respect for the MCA\", and that he was \"ever grateful to the association for the guidance and platform provided over the years\". Shaw, 25, has played five Tests and six ODIs for India, but was dropped from the Mumbai Ranji Trophy side last year on grounds of poor fitness and lack of discipline . Shaw last played for Mumbai in the final of the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy against Madhya Pradesh on December 14, 2024, which his side won by five wickets. But it was his poor fitness and lack of discipline that have made more headlines than his performances on the field over the past many months. \"He needs to get his work ethics right , and if he does that, the sky is the limit for him,\" Mumbai captain Shreyas Iyer had told reporters in Bengaluru after that Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy final last year. \"We can't babysit anyone, right? Every professional who is playing at this level, they need to know what they should be doing. And he has also done it in the past; it's not that he hasn't. He has to focus, he has to sit back, put a thinking cap on, and then figure out himself. He will get the answer by himself.\"",

                "description": "Fulton's side were rarely outplayed and can now focus on the Asia Cup, and qualification for the World Cup.",
                "content": "Going into the European leg of the FIH Pro League, the Indian men's hockey team genuinely had a shot at the title. With 15 points from eight matches, Harmanpreet Singh and co. were ranked third in the table. Eight matches later, the points tally moved up by just three as Craig Fulton's side finished second from bottom. They avoided relegation but had to endure a seven-match losing streak. The only win came against a heavily rotated Belgium side on Sunday. Yes, things did go wrong and seven continuous losses were certainly not expected from this Olympic bronze medal winning team. Despite the results, there's no need to hit the panic button just yet. While there were frustrating moments in all eight matches, India were rarely, if ever, overwhelmed by their opponents and there wasn't a big difference in quality. Six of the seven losses were by a one-goal margin. Twice against the Dutch, India conceded in the last few minutes to lose the game. The same against Australia in their first match. India also gave away goals in the final quarter in both the matches against Argentina. Yes, there were matches where they were outplayed, like the second game against Australia and first one against Belgium but in other games, things could've gone in India's favour. With the benefit of hindsight, it's better to get these results in the Pro League where there's not much at stake. There was a World Cup spot on offer at this tournament, but India will not be too fussed about losing out because their best route for qualification remains the upcoming Asia Cup in late August. Fulton would've seen what went wrong against top sides and there's time to fix them. India's losing run is also a pattern we've seen before. Before the Paris Olympics, India didn't have a good away leg in the Pro League but when it mattered the most, they performed and won a bronze medal. It's clear by now that Fulton's preferred playing style is heavily dependent on a strong defence, which wasn't the case in recent matches in Europe. India conceded 26 goals in eight games which is a long way away from the 12 they conceded in their first eight games at home. The likes of Amit Rohidas, Sumit, Jugraj Singh, Jarmanpreet Singh and Sanjay have been a solid, compact defensive crew under the reign of Fulton. It's not like they suddenly turned from good to bad in Europe but a few errors did end up in goals. Failed clearances, mistimed tackles, wrong positioning in the D and sloppy defensive play proved costly. What also didn't help is the form of goalkeeper Krishan Pathak. Usually reliable when it comes to defending set-pieces, Pathak had more than his fair share of problems, especially when the ball was lifted high. It's here where India still misses the great PR Sreejesh. The former goalkeeper was an exceptional shot-stopper from set-pieces and his clutch quotient used to go up in the final quarter. Both Pathak and Suraj Karkera couldn't stand out the way Sreejesh used to do in crunch moments. A majority of Fulton's squad don't deserve to get dropped after these eight matches. With qualification for the World Cup up next, it's wise to trust these players who have been playing under a particular system for a while. Big changes are not needed right now, and these players are still international quality with years of experience. There are a few selection issues which existed even before India travelled to Europe. Fulton's insistence on sticking with experienced forwards like Mandeep Singh, Lalit Upadhyay ( who announced his retirement on Sunday ) and Dilpreet Singh did not go well in recent matches as these players struggled to create an impact, with inconsistency a recurring problem. On the other hand, Shilanand Lakra, who lacks experience compared to others, showed that little bit extra on the ball and made a case for himself to stay with the national team. Before the Asia Cup, Fulton needs to decide whether young quality attackers like Araijeet Singh Hundal, Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Raheel, who also have international experience, deserve to be picked for the senior team. There are no doubts about this one. The standout player for India in the last eight matches has been Abhishek. It shouldn't be surprising considering he has been the best forward for India for quite some time. His ball-striking ability is among the best in the world. He scored four goals in eight matches, which helped India in the absence of Harmanpreet's dragflicks as the Indian captain missed a few games due to an injury. A few words on Manpreet Singh as well. The veteran star has now played over 400 international matches and his commitment to run the length of the pitch, be it for defending or creating, hasn't come down one bit. His speed may not be the same but he's just relentless on the pitch. Unlike some of the other senior players, he looks certain to be part of the national team for next year's World Cup. The all-important Asia Cup from August 27 to September 7 in Rajgir, Bihar. India are clearly the best team in the continent and they ought to win the tournament and thus qualify for the World Cup.",

                "content": "Ostrava: Unwilling to put himself under pressure of regular 90m throws, Indian javelin throw star Neeraj Chopra says he has a good feeling about Tuesday's Golden Spike Athletics meet here as he builds up for his ultimate goal this year -- a top finish at the World Championship in Tokyo. Chopra defeated Julian Weber to win the Paris Diamond League with a throw of 88.16m last week. The two-time Olympic medallist said with Czech great Jan Zelezny by his side as his coach and with his own determination, he is confident of good results. The 27-year-old is riding high on his maiden 90m plus throw that he achieved in the season-opening Diamond League meet in Doha. \"I am really happy to work with such a great athlete and coach. I've already thrown 90m this year after little bit more improvement in technique. So let's see when it comes next time but I am ready. Recently we've done a good training in Nymburk (Czech Republic) so I'll do my best here in Ostrava,\" he said. \"Main goal for the season is obviously World Championships in Tokyo,\" added the Haryana-lad who won a gold at the previous edition of the biennial showpiece. Chopra said a part of his excitement for the Tuesday's event comes from watching on TV, greats like Usain Bolt compete here in the past. \"When I was kid, I watched a lot of videos and photos of athletes as Usain Bolt competing here. I came last year but I didn't compete because of injury. \"Now I feel good, but I don't want to put any pressure on myself for 90m. But I'll try really hard.\" The World Athletics Championships will be held in Tokyo from September 13 to 21 this year. Chopra, who won gold in 2020 Tokyo Olympics and silver in 2024 Paris, spoke highly about his coach Zelezny. \"When I competed at Diamond League in Doha, there were a lot of Indian people who wanted to take pictures with Jan. And they are sometimes...you know...very intense so I was bit worried about him. But he left to the hotel quickly,\" he said. Besides the World Championships, Chopra is also excited about the Neeraj Chopra Classic javelin throw meet to be held in Bengaluru on July 5. \"This will be my first really serious competition in India with international athletes, on July 5. I still have to manage a lot of things before competition but it will be a good experience,\" he said. \"So now it would not be good if I would say no to people. And I'm happy that now in India people recognise other sports than cricket.\" Talking about his gold-winning throw in Paris Diamond League, Chopra said he is happy with the effort despite not being able to touch the 90m mark. Chopra's coach Zelezny was also quite satisfied with the progress of his ward. \"I am happy about the situation. It's important for javelin and throws in general as athletics, is not only about sprints. Neeraj opened the doors to other countries, it's great for our sport,\" he said.�",

                "content": "By Sejal GuptaA series of distressing food safety incidents about school children falling ill due to contaminated midday meals have made headlines over the past few weeks. From burnt rice in Andhra Pradesh to food ingredients infested with insects in Telangana and remnants of dead snakes in the food in Bihar, hundreds of children have been falling sick from quality compromise in midday meals across the nation. These alarming cases have forced authorities into reactive damage control. However, these are not one-off lapses.According to the UNESCO Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report, only 93 of 187 countries have any legislation, compulsory standards, or guidelines governing food in schools. India’s current framework mirrors this sparse landscape. While the Mid-Day Meal Scheme is commendable in its role in encouraging school attendance and addressing child malnutrition, this string of food safety failures is now revealing critical monitoring gaps. The Department of School Education and Literacy flagged that inspections often focus on conveniently located schools, leaving institutions in other areas neglected. This highlights the systemic weaknesses in India’s food regulatory landscape.India’s food economy is undergoing a dramatic transformation, yet oversight architectures remain fragmented, reactive, and unevenly enforced. This underscores the urgent need to re-examine food regulatory design and enforcement, particularly in the context of growing youth.Beyond school mealsOutside the school ecosystem, food safety challenges multiply. Roughly 70% of India’s food retail is informal. A report by NIH finds that 40.1% of young people eat street food 2–3 times per week (NIH, 2020). Therefore, street vendors play a vital role in daily affordable nutritional consumption. Despite well-established frameworks for hygiene and certification by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), enforcement remains uneven across regions. Many of these vendors operate with limited awareness or capacity to follow guidelines, leading to inconsistencies in food quality and safety.Simultaneously, a new wave of ultra-processed foods and digital food delivery platforms is reshaping eating patterns and gaining large traction among children and youth. These sectors are showcasing dynamic growth rates, often outpacing current regulations.The growing ultra-processed food frenzyGrowing consumption of ultra-processed foods (often high in salt, sugar, and saturated fats), among school and college goers is contributing to rising rates of non-communicable diseases, like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular issues. The disconnect between consumption trends and consumer literacy poses a dual challenge: ensuring informed choices and holding food producers accountable through transparent, easy-to-understand labelling norms.Most national programmes focus on caloric intake and enrolment incentives but pay scant attention to hygiene, food literacy, or health impacts. In the absence of transparent, front-of-pack labelling and robust public health campaigns, informed dietary choices remain out of reach for most parents and children. Children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to persuasive marketing tactics.Learnings can be taken from nations such as Singapore, Chile, and Japan, among others. Japan, through its Shokuiku legislation, mandates that school meals meet strict nutritional standards and use fresh, locally sourced ingredients. Parents are included through workshops and community campaigns. Such models prioritise both hygiene and balanced nutrition through structured curriculum and rigorous oversight.Chile mandates a black octagonal Front-of-Pack (FOP) nutrient warning label, alerting consumers to products high in sugar, salt, saturated fat and calories. Access and marketing restrictions have also been put into effect to safeguard children’s health. Food & Beverage firms are prohibited from using advertising methods targeted towards attracting children, and products that bear the “High in” label are prohibited from advertising during children’s programmes. Additionally, the sale of ultra-processed food has been banned in schools.Digital disruption and regulatory paralysisIndia’s rapidly evolving food delivery and cloud kitchen sectors have created a new class of challenges, making both ultra-processed and pre-cooked food more accessible, affordable, and convenient for the youth.Cloud kitchens and 10-minute delivery models prioritise speed, sometimes at the expense of hygiene and food safety. Unawareness of food handling and underdeveloped cold chain infrastructures have been leading to food spoilage and food safety compromises in transit and distribution. Further, the emergence of 10-minute delivery services has raised new regulatory alarms. Many operate out of dark stores, spaces that are unregulated and unlicensed, and in conjunction with small vendors that lack proper sanitary infrastructure.With over 20,000 cloud kitchens operating in India, and the number expected to double by 2026, the rapid growth of the online food economy has far outpaced regulatory measures. According to FSSAI data, over 21,000 complaints were filed against online food platforms between 2019 and 2024, citing hygiene lapses in packaging, misleading labelling, and substandard quality. About 1,500 vendor licenses have been cancelled, and penalties exceeding Rs. 210 crores have been imposed. Concerns are rising over misleading information, inconsistent quality and lack of traceability. These numbers reveal systemic weaknesses in monitoring and compliance within the food e-commerce ecosystem. Currently, no tailored food safety frameworks are in place for online food/grocery platforms.Call for dynamic governanceAs consumption patterns and methods evolve, ensuring that food remains safe and nutritious, especially at growing ages, is increasingly important. With the proliferation of processed foods and the rising demand for convenience, maintaining stringent food safety standards is essential. The multiplicity of food sources impacting the health of India’s youth, including schools, aggregators, and street vendors, calls for unified, proactive, and strictly enforceable food safety frameworks. The dynamic nature of this industry requires that regulations be anticipatory and adaptive rather than reactionary.Anandini Gupta is a Research Fellow at the Centre for Development Policy and Practice (CDPP), with work experience in finance and communications.

With its flagship initiative, the ITrend Series, the Pune-based real estate company is steering the industry in a bold new direction: toward thoughtful, lifestyle-first development designed for the modern urban Indian. Also Read | Diwali 2025 Start and End Dates: When Is Deepawali? Know Dhanteras, Choti Diwali and Lakshmi Puja Timings, Important Rituals and Significance To Celebrate the Festival. Over the last few years, Pune's transformation into a vibrant tech and education hub has reshaped the demand for housing but Saheel Properties saw something deeper, i.e., a shift in how people live. The ITrend Series was born not just to answer that need but to anticipate it. Today, it is being hailed by industry insiders and buyers alike as a benchmark in contemporary urban housing, where design intelligence, smart space utilization, and emotional comfort converge. With ongoing and completed projects across high-demand zones such as Wakad, Tathawade, Baner NX, Hinjawadi, Chinchwad, and Ravet, ITrend properties offer not just prime connectivity but an ecosystem that supports modern living. However, what sets the series apart is its commitment to redefining the fundamentals of home design. This isn't luxury for luxury's sake; it's lifestyle logic, executed with engineering excellence. Also Read | Air India Express Flight IX-2564 From Delhi to Srinagar via Jammu Returns Midway, Airline Cites Technical Issue. At the heart of ITrend's success is its meticulous design approach. Homes within the series come with zero space wastage, flexible layouts, and convertible usage zones, allowing residents to adapt spaces as their needs change. From compact apartments that feel expansive to two-bedroom homes that serve like a three, each layout is a masterclass in space efficiency. Added amenities such as in-wing guest suites, dedicated work-from-home pods, and exclusive visitor parking only enhance the liveability factor. This design foresight is no accident. Saheel's team spent years understanding the post-pandemic lifestyle shift, how people work, socialize, and retreat within their homes. What emerged was a blueprint for responsive living. Not trends for the moment, but solutions for a lifetime. \"We didn't just ask what people want today,\" says a spokesperson at Saheel Properties. \"We asked what they'll need ten years from now, and built with that in mind.\" Beyond architecture, what truly powers the ITrend Series is trust. In an industry where delays and overpromises are far too common, Saheel has delivered over 2,500 homes on time, every time. Known for transparency, quality, and integrity, the company has cultivated a reputation that few developers can claim, and buyers can count on. The ITrend Series has also forced a larger conversation within Pune's real estate circles. Its popularity is pushing the industry to re-evaluate what constitutes real value: not marble-laden lobbies, but functional layouts. Not excessive amenities, but intuitive planning. Not brochure claims, but lived comfort. In doing so, ITrend is not just a housing brand, it's a mindset shift. The journey doesn't stop here. With several upcoming launches, Saheel Properties plans to scale the ITrend philosophy even further, integrating smart automation, sustainable construction, and curated community design. The future ITrend homes will not just be addresses, but anchor points of a balanced and fulfilling urban lifestyle. As Pune continues its upward trajectory as one of India's most liveable cities, Saheel Properties is proving that the future of real estate lies not in replicating what's been done, but in anticipating what's next. And through the ITrend Series, they're not just keeping pace with the city, they're leading it. (ADVERTORIAL DISCLAIMER: The above press release has been provided by VMPL.

                "content": "Prithvi Shaw has written to the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) seeking a transfer ahead of the upcoming domestic season. \"I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) for the valuable opportunities and unwavering support extended to me during my time representing the association,\" Shaw wrote in the letter, which an MCA official confirmed the body had received. \"It has truly been an honor and a privilege to be part of the MCA setup, and I am deeply grateful for the exposure and experience I have gained here.\" Explaining his reasons for wanting to leave Shaw wrote: \"At this juncture in my career, I have been presented with a promising opportunity to play professional cricket under another State Association, which I believe will further contribute to my growth and development as a cricketer. \"In light of this, I kindly request you to issue me a No Objection Certificate (NOC) that will enable me to officially represent the new State Association in the upcoming domestic season.\" Shaw said his decision has been made after \"careful consideration, and with utmost respect for the MCA\", and that he was \"ever grateful to the association for the guidance and platform provided over the years\". Shaw, 25, has played five Tests and six ODIs for India, but was dropped from the Mumbai Ranji Trophy side last year on grounds of poor fitness and lack of discipline . Shaw last played for Mumbai in the final of the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy against Madhya Pradesh on December 14, 2024, which his side won by five wickets. But it was his poor fitness and lack of discipline that have made more headlines than his performances on the field over the past many months. \"He needs to get his work ethics right , and if he does that, the sky is the limit for him,\" Mumbai captain Shreyas Iyer had told reporters in Bengaluru after that Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy final last year. \"We can't babysit anyone, right? Every professional who is playing at this level, they need to know what they should be doing. And he has also done it in the past; it's not that he hasn't. He has to focus, he has to sit back, put a thinking cap on, and then figure out himself. He will get the answer by himself.\"",

                "content": "Going into the European leg of the FIH Pro League, the Indian men's hockey team genuinely had a shot at the title. With 15 points from eight matches, Harmanpreet Singh and co. were ranked third in the table. Eight matches later, the points tally moved up by just three as Craig Fulton's side finished second from bottom. They avoided relegation but had to endure a seven-match losing streak. The only win came against a heavily rotated Belgium side on Sunday. Yes, things did go wrong and seven continuous losses were certainly not expected from this Olympic bronze medal winning team. Despite the results, there's no need to hit the panic button just yet. While there were frustrating moments in all eight matches, India were rarely, if ever, overwhelmed by their opponents and there wasn't a big difference in quality. Six of the seven losses were by a one-goal margin. Twice against the Dutch, India conceded in the last few minutes to lose the game. The same against Australia in their first match. India also gave away goals in the final quarter in both the matches against Argentina. Yes, there were matches where they were outplayed, like the second game against Australia and first one against Belgium but in other games, things could've gone in India's favour. With the benefit of hindsight, it's better to get these results in the Pro League where there's not much at stake. There was a World Cup spot on offer at this tournament, but India will not be too fussed about losing out because their best route for qualification remains the upcoming Asia Cup in late August. Fulton would've seen what went wrong against top sides and there's time to fix them. India's losing run is also a pattern we've seen before. Before the Paris Olympics, India didn't have a good away leg in the Pro League but when it mattered the most, they performed and won a bronze medal. It's clear by now that Fulton's preferred playing style is heavily dependent on a strong defence, which wasn't the case in recent matches in Europe. India conceded 26 goals in eight games which is a long way away from the 12 they conceded in their first eight games at home. The likes of Amit Rohidas, Sumit, Jugraj Singh, Jarmanpreet Singh and Sanjay have been a solid, compact defensive crew under the reign of Fulton. It's not like they suddenly turned from good to bad in Europe but a few errors did end up in goals. Failed clearances, mistimed tackles, wrong positioning in the D and sloppy defensive play proved costly. What also didn't help is the form of goalkeeper Krishan Pathak. Usually reliable when it comes to defending set-pieces, Pathak had more than his fair share of problems, especially when the ball was lifted high. It's here where India still misses the great PR Sreejesh. The former goalkeeper was an exceptional shot-stopper from set-pieces and his clutch quotient used to go up in the final quarter. Both Pathak and Suraj Karkera couldn't stand out the way Sreejesh used to do in crunch moments. A majority of Fulton's squad don't deserve to get dropped after these eight matches. With qualification for the World Cup up next, it's wise to trust these players who have been playing under a particular system for a while. Big changes are not needed right now, and these players are still international quality with years of experience. There are a few selection issues which existed even before India travelled to Europe. Fulton's insistence on sticking with experienced forwards like Mandeep Singh, Lalit Upadhyay ( who announced his retirement on Sunday ) and Dilpreet Singh did not go well in recent matches as these players struggled to create an impact, with inconsistency a recurring problem. On the other hand, Shilanand Lakra, who lacks experience compared to others, showed that little bit extra on the ball and made a case for himself to stay with the national team. Before the Asia Cup, Fulton needs to decide whether young quality attackers like Araijeet Singh Hundal, Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Raheel, who also have international experience, deserve to be picked for the senior team. There are no doubts about this one. The standout player for India in the last eight matches has been Abhishek. It shouldn't be surprising considering he has been the best forward for India for quite some time. His ball-striking ability is among the best in the world. He scored four goals in eight matches, which helped India in the absence of Harmanpreet's dragflicks as the Indian captain missed a few games due to an injury. A few words on Manpreet Singh as well. The veteran star has now played over 400 international matches and his commitment to run the length of the pitch, be it for defending or creating, hasn't come down one bit. His speed may not be the same but he's just relentless on the pitch. Unlike some of the other senior players, he looks certain to be part of the national team for next year's World Cup. The all-important Asia Cup from August 27 to September 7 in Rajgir, Bihar. India are clearly the best team in the continent and they ought to win the tournament and thus qualify for the World Cup.",
